## Reliability of Rotation Axis Estimation

Given that we only have data from **five maser galaxies**, the reliability of our rotation axis estimation is limited. With such a small sample size, it's challenging to accurately triangulate the exact location and orientation of the rotation axis. The estimation is more of an educated guess based on the available data and certain assumptions:

- **Assumptions Made**:
  - We assume that the rotation axis is aligned in some way with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) dipole and quadrupole axes.
  - We consider Earth's position relative to these axes to estimate its location in the universe.
  - The maser galaxies are assumed to be representative of the larger cosmic structure, which may not be the case.

- **Limitations**:
  - **Sample Size**: Five data points are insufficient for precise triangulation in three-dimensional space.
  - **Measurement Errors**: Uncertainties in distance measurements and redshift velocities can significantly affect the estimation.
  - **Simplifications in the Model**: The model assumes a simple rotational motion without accounting for complex gravitational interactions and local motions.

Therefore, while the rotation axis estimation provides a starting point for our hypothetical model, it should not be considered precise. More data points and a more sophisticated model would be required for a reliable determination.

## Notes

- The rotation axis is positioned at the center of the universe (0, 0, 0).
- Earth's position is calculated based on the CMB dipole and estimated rotation of the universe.
- Maser coordinates are adjusted relative to the central rotation axis.
- This model is highly speculative and should be interpreted with caution. It does not reflect the current scientific understanding of the universe's structure and dynamics.
- The visualization of this data can be found in the accompanying 3D plot file.
